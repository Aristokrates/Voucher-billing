Subscription:
This policy will work like this (more or less):

    Default - all new accounts use the default price option. The default price option is to pay for each transaction as we have currently implemented.
    Monthly subscription - users can upgrade to a monthly transaction fee (R10.00 a month for example). This fee is set by Admin in the Management UI.
    Annual subscription - user can opt to pay a annual/yearly payment for transaction fees (R100.00 a month for example). This fee is set by Admin in the Management UI.
    Important - if a user is on monthly or annual subscription, then they are not charged a per transaction fee (default option).
    The user can set/select subscription in Profile section.
